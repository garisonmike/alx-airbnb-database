\# Database Seeding – ALX Airbnb Clone



This directory contains SQL scripts to populate the database with \*\*sample data\*\* for the ALX Airbnb project.



\## Overview

The `seed.sql` file inserts sample records for:

\- \*\*Users\*\* – Basic user accounts with hashed passwords

\- \*\*Properties\*\* – Listings owned by users

\- \*\*Bookings\*\* – Reservations made by users for properties

\- \*\*Reviews\*\* – Feedback left by users after their stay



\## Purpose

Seeding helps simulate a real-world scenario for testing and development. It ensures the database has meaningful data to:

\- Test queries and relationships

\- Validate schema design

\- Run initial demos



\## How to Use

1\. Ensure your database schema is created (run `schema.sql` first).

2\. Connect to your database using your preferred client (e.g., `mysql`, `psql`, or any GUI).

3\. Run:

&nbsp;  ```bash
